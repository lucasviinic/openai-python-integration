# OpenAI Python Integration

This repository comprises my studies regarding the integration of a Python project with the OpenAI API.

**Step 1:** API Integration

- Adjusting Playground parameters such as temperature and maximum length to control the creativity and output of GPT, aiming to generate more coherent and context-adapted responses.
- Utilizing the OpenAI library to make requests to the API and generate responses from a GPT-3.5 model, learning how to pass system and user messages, as well as safeguarding the API key for security.
- Hiding identification keys in environment variables to protect sensitive information when performing API integrations.

**Step 2:** Prompt engineering and prompt template

- Using the GPT-3 API to categorize products in an e-commerce context, adjusting parameters to obtain multiple responses, and exploring the API documentation to understand its operation and available options.
- Enhancing the system prompt to guide GPT model responses with strategies such as specifying the desired output format and providing examples.
- Creating a product categorization function using a prompt template to dynamically insert parameters such as valid categories and product names, enabling a more flexible and organized interaction with the code.
