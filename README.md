# OpenAI Python Integration

This repository comprises my studies regarding the integration of a Python project with the OpenAI API.

**Step 1:** API Integration

- Adjusting Playground parameters such as temperature and maximum length to control the creativity and output of GPT, aiming to generate more coherent and context-adapted responses.
- Utilizing the OpenAI library to make requests to the API and generate responses from a GPT-3.5 model, learning how to pass system and user messages, as well as safeguarding the API key for security.
- Hiding identification keys in environment variables to protect sensitive information when performing API integrations.
